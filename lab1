The Absolute path before the command was ran was /Users/luishernandez.
The command had no output due to us having no argument in the command.
Since cd means change directory, not providing an argument means we do not change the directory.
This leaves us at our home directory.

My absolute path before running the command was /Users/luishernandez.
THe command changed the directory to lecture1.
This was due to us providing an argument, lecture1.
This output did not create an error due to lecture1 being a directory that could be reached.

My absolute path before running the command was /Users/luishernandez/lecture1.
The command did not have any output due to the command creating an error.
This command created an error due cd wanting to change directory, but since I providied a file.
This creates an error.
