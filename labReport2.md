There is only one method called in my first screenshot and that is the handle request method which returns a string. Important values in this screen shot is the `String[]` str, which holds what the users mesaage is, the array of strings `String[]` user, which hold what the input for the username is, the `String` result, which holds what will be outputed, the `String[]` parameters, which is used to ensure that the input the user made was correct.With the specific requests I made it cretaed three users in the user array, and three messages in the str array. THe parameters variable also changed due to us updating the url to get different outputs in the website.In the result it combined the str and user arrays into a string, seperated by \n.

With the specific requests added on top of the original requests added one more user in the array and three more messages in the str array. This then changes the result `String` to hold more of the previous chat history. This also changes the array variable parameters, as we are changing what is held in them by changing the url constanly to have more users and messages.

## Part 3

Something I learned in lab week 2 was that UCSD had its own remote server, in which falculty and students attending can access it through their email and password. Another thing I learned in lab week 2 was that through terminal we can complie code with an input and it can give us a url that can on ly be accessed through our device, as well as the ability to change what the website outputs through editing the url. Something I learned in lab week 3 is that we can access the remote server through vs code as well and not just the terminal.
