There is only one method called in my first screenshot and that is the handle request method which returns a string. Important values in this screen shot is the `String[]` str, which holds what the users mesaage is, the array of strings `String[]` user, which hold what the input for the username is, the `String` result, which holds what will be outputed, the `String[]` parameters, which is used to ensure that the input the user made was correct.

## Part 3

Something I learned in lab week 2 was that UCSD had its own remote server, in which falculty and students attending can access it through their email and password. Another thing I learned in lab week 2 was that through terminal we can complie code with an input and it can give us a url that can on ly be accessed through our device, as well as the ability to change what the website outputs through editing the url. Something I learned in lab week 3 is that we can access the remote server through vs code as well and not just the terminal.
